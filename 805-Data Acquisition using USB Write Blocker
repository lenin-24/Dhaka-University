This task mainly helps to create a exact copy of the contnets which the imposter had so that the forensics team can analyze 
the data for any signs of malicious activity (e.g., a hacker’s actions) without touching the original USB.
Example- Samin was smuggling company top secret to Nayeem via pendrive but got caught by company and now to prove his misdeeds the company 
brought Lenin a digital Forensics expert to see what types of things he did so without risking of data in usb Lenin made a copy of everything in usb without entering it and 
did analysis to have proof of Samins bad activities.


Step1- download the write blocker 
(((It is used so that third part cant manipulate data from this device by writing anything or deleting)))
https://sourceforge.net/projects/usbwriteblockerforwindows8/

Step2- extract and open the main file than write 1 and press enter. it will start the weite blocker.

Step3- Insert the pendrive now 
(((If you insert the pendrive before activating the write blocker, there’s a risk of unintended write operations (e.g., Windows updating file access timestamps or creating system files).
This could compromise the forensic validity of the data, as even minor changes can affect hash values and evidence admissibility.)))
