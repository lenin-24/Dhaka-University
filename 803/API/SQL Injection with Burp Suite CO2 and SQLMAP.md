# SQL Injection with Burp Suite CO2 and SQLMAP

### 1st we need to install CO2 extension from Burp Suite Extensions → BApp Store

Now we need to install sqlmap, For kali linux we can simply use caommand sudo apt
install sqlmap

But for this tutorial, we will use sqlmap in windows. To install in windows simply
download sqlmap from here →

https://github.com/sqlmapproject/sqlmap/archive/refs/tags/1.8.zip


Extract this and go to the extracted folder.

Go to the extracted folder. And open command prompt from here by running cmd
in the address bar.

Command Prompt will open here. Now we can run sqlmap by running command
python3 sqlmap.py

or 

python sqlmap.py

as some windpws have problem with python3
