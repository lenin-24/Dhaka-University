### Intro 

The are mainly two purpose of rate limiting Firstly, it helps API providers prevent abuse or overuse of their resources.
Without rate limits, a single user or application could make an excessive number of requests, potentially causing
performance issues for the API and affecting other users. Rate limiting acts as a safeguard against such scenarios.
Secondly, rate limiting is a tool for API monetization. It allows providers to offer different levels of service to different users
based on subscription plans. For instance, free users might have a lower rate limit, while premium users with a paid
subscription could enjoy higher limits, faster response times, or additional features.
