# lab work revolves around ethical penetration testing using the Cyber Kill Chain model, with two main practical tracks

    1. Windows-based client-side attack (via payload delivery and privilege escalation)
    2. Server-side FTP vulnerability exploitation (on Metasploitable Linux)

## 🔧 Prerequisites
```
Make sure you have:

    VirtualBox (or VMware)
    Kali Linux (attacker machine)
    Windows 7 VM (victim client) — for Track 1
    Metasploitable Linux 2 (vulnerable server) — for Track 2
    All VMs on the same network mode (Host-only or Bridged as needed)
```
