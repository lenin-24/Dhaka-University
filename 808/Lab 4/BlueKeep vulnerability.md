## Intro
BlueKeep (CVE-2019-0708) is a critical security flaw in Microsoft’s Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) that lets an attacker take full control of a vulnerable Windows computer—without needing a password or user interaction.

## How it works:
The attacker sends a malformed RDP request that exploits a memory handling error (use-after-free) in the Windows RDP service. This lets them run arbitrary code as SYSTEM (highest privilege)—all before logging in.
**Why it’s dangerous**: It’s wormable—can spread automatically across networks like WannaCry.
