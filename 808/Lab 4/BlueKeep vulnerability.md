## Intro
BlueKeep (CVE-2019-0708) is a critical security flaw in Microsoft’s Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) that lets an attacker take full control of a vulnerable Windows computer—without needing a password or user interaction.

## 🔍 What Is RDP?

Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is a Microsoft protocol that allows users to remotely control another computer over a network. It’s commonly used by IT administrators for remote support or access.

RDP typically runs on TCP port 3389.


## How it works:
The attacker sends a malformed RDP request that exploits a memory handling error (use-after-free) in the Windows RDP service. This lets them run arbitrary code as SYSTEM (highest privilege)—all before logging in.
**Why it’s dangerous**: It’s wormable—can spread automatically across networks like WannaCry.

## To perform RDP exploitation using the BlueKeep vulnerability (CVE-2019-0708) on your Windows 7 VM (192.168.56.103) from Kali Linux (192.168.56.106), follow this step-by-step 

### Prerequisites
```
    **Target** 
    :  Windows 7 SP1 (unpatched, RDP enabled)
        **Ensure RDP is enabled:**
        Control Panel > System > Remote Settings > Allow Remote Assistance connections
    **Attacker** : Kali Linux (192.168.56.106)
    Both VMs must be on the same network (e.g., Host-only or Bridged in VirtualBox)
